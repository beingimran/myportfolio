          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            I specialize in building end to end Software applications other
            backend technologies. Iâ€™m passionate about learning new technologies
            and understand there is more than one way to accomplish a task.
            Though I am most proficient in building front-end and backend
            applications using React,Nextjs,flutter,Django,Flask,Nodejs,GraphQl
            and other front-end and backend Techonology .I am a quick learner
            and can pick up new tech stacks as needed. I believe that being a
            great developer is not using one specific language, but choosing the
            best tool for the job.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">

            experience working directly with clients and taking mock wireframes
            all the way to deployed applications. In my spare time I invest in
